# Definition of a Maze:
   maze grid with barriers
   
# Problem:
   To find one path through a maze starting at a designated beginning ending at the treasure without reaching any stepping       
   stone more than once.
  
# Recursive Abstraction
   When I am asked to 
   
      find one path through a maze starting at a designated beginning ending at the treasure without reaching any stepping stone more than once,
      
   The recursive abstraction can
   
      find one path through a maze starting one step closer to the treasure ending at the treasure without reaching any stepping stone more than once
